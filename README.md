# WebLinter – Baseline-Aware Feature Checker

**WebLinter** is a CLI tool that helps developers detect the use of web features (like CSS properties or HTML elements) that **aren’t yet part of the [Web Platform Baseline](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/web-platform-baseline/)** — helping ensure broader browser compatibility and fewer surprises in production.

## 🌐 Why WebLinter?

In the fast-moving world of frontend development, it's easy to use features that are *technically standardized* but still *not universally supported*.

The **Web Platform Baseline** defines the set of features that are reliably available across all modern browsers — without requiring polyfills or fallback logic.

### ❗ The Problem

You add a shiny new CSS feature like `backdrop-filter`, it works on your machine, and looks great. But your users on other browsers? Blank screens. Broken layouts. Confusion.

### ✅ The Solution

**WebLinter** scans your codebase, detects features not yet in the Baseline, and alerts you — early. No surprises. No regressions.

It’s powered by [web-features](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features), the same dataset used by MDN and Chrome DevRel.

## 🔍 Features

* **Baseline-Aware Detection**
  Flags usage of CSS and HTML features that are not in the Baseline.

* **CSS & HTML Analysis**
  Uses **PostCSS** and **Parse5** to deeply parse files for accurate results.

* **Smart File Scanning**
  Supports custom `paths`, `extensions`, and `exclude` patterns for precise scanning.

* **Caching System**
  Feature usage data is cached locally, improving performance for repeated runs. Configurable via `cacheDays`.

* **Helpful Warnings**
  CLI output includes **line numbers**, **context**, and **baseline status** — with both warnings and errors.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Initialization

The first time you run:

```bash
npx weblinter
```

**WebLinter will automatically:**

* Create a `.weblinter` config file in your project root if it doesn't exist yet.
* Generate and cache feature usage data in a `.weblinter_data` folder (ignored by Git).

You can customize `.weblinter` like this:

```json
{
  "paths": ["src", "components"],                     // Folders to include for linting
  "extensions": ["css", "html"],                      // File extensions to lint
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.json", "dist"],   // Paths or patterns to exclude
  "cacheDays": 10,                                    // Number of days to cache parsed files
  "showNotFoundResults": false                        // Show results for missing files (set to true to debug missing paths)
}
```

If you want, you can also explicitly create the config file anytime by running:

```bash
npx weblinter init
```

## 🧪 Example Output

```bash
❌ Non-baseline feature found:

→ /example/style.css
  Warnings (low baseline):
    ⚠ css.properties.backdrop-filter
  Errors (non-baseline):
    ✖ css.properties.interpolate-size
    ✖ css.properties.overlay
    ✖ css.properties.reading-flow
```

> Each result is tied to real feature identifiers from the `web-features` dataset — the same canonical source used by Chrome and MDN.

## 🧱 How It Works

| Component        | Role                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `web-features`   | Official dataset of web platform features  |
| `PostCSS`        | Parses CSS to find feature usage           |
| `Parse5`         | Parses HTML and extracts relevant features |
| `Globby`         | Efficient file searching via glob patterns |
| `Commander.js`   | CLI argument parsing and interface         |
| `Chalk`          | Styled terminal output                     |
| **Custom Cache** | Stores analysis results for performance    |

## 🚧 Roadmap / Future Improvements

* JS/TS support (via Babel parsing)
* Framework-aware detection (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
* Plugin support (Webpack, Vite, etc.)
* VS Code extension for real-time linting
